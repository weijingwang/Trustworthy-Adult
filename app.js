      I saw a lot of bots but all of them didn't work for me and they made me\
      really mad. So I decided to make my own bot by glue coding since I\
      don't know javascript yeah?\
      this bot is currently run on my computer so it will only be on when I\
      am on so far. I might migrate it to somewhere else maybe.\
      thank kyler for some python syntax --> js help!\
      This bot is actually like a branch-off\
      of the original bot called *Trustable Adult* (The one made on June 22 2018).\
      I do not know what happened? (❁°͈▵°͈)\
      Trustable Adult used to be so trustworthy but it started\
      censoring out god and xxxxxxxxxxx!!! That is against my religion!!!\
      THIS IS OBVIOUSLY THE MORE TRUSTABLE ADULT HERE SINCE THIS AIKO KITSUNE CHAN\
      DOES NOT ENCOURAGE HEAVY CENSORSHIP. Trusworthy adults may not like too much\
      cursing but censoring things in a not-censored enviroment is just not very right.\
      Trustable Adult became Helicoper Parent Adult!!! Oh no!! 大変だ！！！ 不好！\
      Hopefully you guys support me and we will convert the now *Helicopter Parent Adult*\
      into believing our beliefs! GOGOGO!!! June 24, 2018'");
